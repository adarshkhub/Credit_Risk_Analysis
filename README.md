# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Supervised Machine Learning applied to assess Credit Risk 

## Overview   
It is understood that good loans outnumber risky loans, making credit risk an unbalanced classification problem. We can use various supervised machine learning methods  to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. We use three types, Resampling models (oversampling with RandomOverSampler and SMOTE and undersampling with ClusterCentroids) the SMOTEEN Algorithm, and ensemble classifiers (EasyEnsembleClassifier, and BalancedRandomForest). Logistic

## Purpose: 
1. Explain how a machine learning algorithm is used in data analytics.
2. Create training and test groups from a given data set.
3. Implement the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
4. Interpret the results of the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
5. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of each supervised learning algorithm.
6. Determine which supervised learning algorithm is best used for a given data set or scenario.
7. Use ensemble and resampling techniques to improve model performance.
